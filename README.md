A free Pomodoro timer and Task tracker

Developing a free Pomodoro Timer and Task Tracker for students to better track down their day and increase their productivity. Project is already in its alpha phase, there's some more features to be added and then the app will be first launched on the web and then for Android and Windows (as .exe). I'll try to keep updating the progress here as well, for now here's a basic screenshot of the UI on web.
