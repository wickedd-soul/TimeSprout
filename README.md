# TimeSprout
A free Pomodoro timer and Task tracker

Developing a free Pomodoro Timer and Task Tracker for students to better track down their day and increase their productivity. Project is already in its alpha phase, there's some more features to be added and then the app will be first launched on the web and then for Android and Windows (as .exe). I'll try to keep updating the progress here as well, for now here's a basic screenshot of the UI on web.

UPDATE: 9 April 2025:-
The basic functions have been added to the TimeSprout web version. The UI has also been changed significantly and will be soon hosted on web. Till then it can be used by downloading the html file and running it using any browser. 
NOTE: The web version is currently optimized only for PC and not for smartphone, so you might find some glitch if you try to open it on smartphone.
